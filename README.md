# Learning Python

The exercises in this repo are based on [Dive into Python3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) and [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html).

It is also worth looking at the [Hitchiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) for opinionated views on how to organise Python projects and good Python style and syntax.

## Getting Python

OSX comes with Python 2.7 by default.

## Managing Python environments

To control what version of the Python interpreter you are using [you can use pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). To control which versions of libraries your program uses you use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
